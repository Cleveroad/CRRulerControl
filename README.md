A CocoaPod that simplifies the process of setting and reading values from the ruler.

Creating control elements is rather a simple task. However, it may take fairly large amount of time. To save this time, Cleveroad has created one of the control elements called CRRulerControl. CRRulerControl is a UIControl that can adjust to any your requirements in just a few seconds.

## Requirements
* iOS 8 or higher

## Example

To run the example project, clone the repo, and run `pod install` from the Example directory first.

## Installation

CRRulerControl is available through [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org). To install
it, simply add the following line to your Podfile:

```ruby
pod "CRRulerControl"
```
and run pod install in terminal.
